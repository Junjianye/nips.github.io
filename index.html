    <h1>Causal Graph Learning from Event Sequences and Prior Knowledge</h1>
    <p>In this competition, we are focusing on a fundamental causal challenge: participants are asked to learn the causal alarm graphs in which every node is an alarm type
from some observable historical alarm datasets along with little prior knowledge. The challenge originates from a real-world RCA (Root Cause Analysis) scenario in a telecommunication network. By addressing this challenge, participants will
not only help operators trouble-shooting efficiently, but also advance the field of causal discovery, and contribute to our understanding of complex systems.</p>
